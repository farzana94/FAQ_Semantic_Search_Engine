It arrives with the brightness turned all the way up, so you need to turn that down, but that was the only quible. The video resolution and image quality is high enough that I have no difficulty reading."

A set of four 25mm button-top M4 screws with a washer on each screw should do the trick, although most mounts come with screws for all types of setups, and they\u2019re exact length, too."

I personally don\u2019t know the answer to this question, but not reviewed said the following: I use this little TV primarily as a display for both my MacBook Pro and my Surface; indeed I spend much more time using it this way as a computer display than as a TV. It works superbly as a display. That said, I do watch some TV, both over the air broadcasts and streaming Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Apple TV+, and CBS All Access, all of which are available on the TV. Also, I've tried streaming from a Roku box. All of these work extremely well. My only minor beef is that the remote is very sparse. One has to pop up the home menu on the screen to find the inputs and settings. No good instructions come with the TV which also hinders quickly learning the system. To get any good help requires using the online instructions. In spite of my minor negative comment (having gotten use to Samsung's menu system), I would definitely get this TV again. based on tbat the answer appear to be yes!"

On Amazon for instance, there is a 'digital handshake' that assures you system can't copy HD content. I got some Amazon basic connectors that are HDCP protected, an HDMI cord and a multi outlet box, also specified HDCP. That worked for me. MY computer monitor says HDCP so no problem streaming."

                    "Answer": "If you just wish to watch regular or cable TV, you don't need to connect your TV to the Internet, which is what WiFi enables. But if you want to use the Smart TV features, such as streaming TV shows and movies, and watching YouTube videos on your TV, you need to enable your TV to access the Internet. I think most people nowadays make that connection via WiFi. If you don't have a wireless connection (which is what WiFi is), I believe you can connect this product to the Internet via a wired connection from the TV to a router/modem, i.e., an ethernet cable, as this link indicates -- https://motorolamentor.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002643374-Connecting-Samsung-smart-TV-to-ethernet-or-wifi- . I think this Samsung TV has an ethernet connection, but if you don't have WiFi, and need a wired connection, I suggest you do further digging to make sure a wired connection will work for your particular set up...assuming in the first place that you do access the Internet."

As to whether it will work in what President Trump calls an (first word filtered) 'excrement country' you should google to research what electrical adapter(s) you'll need. Another complication is you may need to purchase a generator for backup power during outages. You'll also need an input source such as satellite or cable tv, or an antenna capable of receiving transmissions at the required distance from your location. Yes, \"much complications\". Perhaps best to ask your question in an electronics store in your location, & then return to Amazon for a better price on the tv."

                    "Question": "Will this tv be okay to use outside on a covered porch?",
                    "Answer": "The short answer is \"no\". The longer answer is \"depending upon your environment and expectations\". The manufacturer's environmental specs say operating temperature is 10\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C (50\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F) and humidity 10% to 80%, non-condensing. Think about the weather and temperature for your area of the country. Also, this is not a sealed, outdoor rated unit. Leaving the unit outside, even on a covered porch, may lead to dust, insects and condensation entering the case and depositing on the circuit boards, leading to premature failure. Also, the higher ambient light levels outside (even on a porch) may lead to a less then satisfying image quality. If you are going to cover the unit when not in use, or seal it in a back cabinet, you may have better results. An outdoor rated unit, while more expensive, will give you a more satisfying outcome and long term, failure free operations."

However, I have the Fire Stick, which I had bought for my older TV, and the Stick involves some same considerations as the Cube. Both require plugging into an HDMI port and both come with a remote, tho the Cube is more hands free and has more features. When I got my 32N5300 TV, I could access Amazon Prime without the Fire Stick, but I missed the Fire Stick remote and voice control, and the more control the Fire Stick afforded streaming from the Amazon Prime app. So I plugged the Stick into the 2nd HDMI port, and now use that port to access most of my streaming stuff, with the benefit of the remote. I assume that you could do the same with the Cube, but you'll have to make sure from another source of info. I hope this helps."

Pressing the home icon brings up the smart TV menu at the bottom of your screen. At that point use the arrows below the home icon to scroll down to the row of media services that has Netflix and Amazon Prime tabs, and then move the appropriate sideways arrow to highlight (enlarge a bit) your choice. Upon highlighting your selection, press the enter/OK button in the middle of the arrows to bring up the servoce you've selected. If you make a mistake, hit the home icon button to bring you back to where you started. You can then begin again to find what you're looking for. To go back to regular TV, hit the exit button on the remote once or twice. When you turn on the TV, the smart menu comes up and lingers for a short while, so you have a bit of time to use the Samsung remote to scroll down to whatever media service you want to access, without having to hit the home icon button."

They work for a day or two then you can't turn them on until you unplug them for 30-60 seconds. Then they work fine for another day or two and you have to do it again. If you call Samsung for help they tell you to take it to one of their repair vendors to have it fixed. Mine was 30 miles away and I live in Tampa. I finally got a Vizio the same type and size and have not had a problem with it, and it was cheaper. I hope this helps you. Good luck with whatever you do."

The \u201ctypical power\u201d on the back of the TV is 27 Watts. So you would want an inverter to \u201cat least\u201d cover this wattage. I bought a 600 Watt pure sine power inverter for my pellet stove in case of power outages but do not need it now that I have power generator I can plug into. If you are off the grid, which I am assuming, is the reason why you need the inverter. Buy one to cover the power wattage or a little more but as I said before I am not an expert. Good luck."

Do your measurements of the legs width of the t.v. and add about 12\" to the table/stand top so it fits with some room for each side of the end of the t.v. legs. The measurement of the t.v. legs are seen at each of the t.v. description of dimensions, i.e. length, width, height and it most likely will have the measurements of the legs from the end of the t.v. and the in between length of the two legs.

One side of the leg is longer than the other side and the longer leg faces forward because the tv leans forward more than it does backwards. I have mine mounted on the wall."

Just use proper lead anchors into the grout betweet the brick, or drill into the brick themselves and use proper anchor bolts. I would just check the weight of the TV and make sure that its compatible with the VESA compatible mounting system that you're using. Just make sure that the anchoring system in the brick is secure using conventional building standards. Also these bigger televisions are about 100 pounds, so make sure that the mounting brackets that you use are rated for that much weight also. ..... And for goodness sakes \"load test\" your brackets before you put your expensive new television on them. You should be fine. If you are unsure of your skills get a professional TV installer to hang it."

Your programming provider needs to make sure your receiver for that programming is a 4K receiver. You also have to make sure all your cables are 4k. If you have a movie player and you want to watch 4k movies that are formatted 4k, you have to make sure you own a 4k movie player. Most programming coming into the TV is not in a 4k format yet. They are still working on that. That is why you will see advertisements that some special sporting event is being broadcasted in 4k."

For example, you have a uhd blu-ray player, you would run one hdmi cable from the blu ray player output to sound bar input, then another hdmi cable from sound bar output to the tv hdmi/arc input. Most sound bars can also connect via Bluetooth and optical audio cable. If you really get stuck, YouTube has some great tutorials search \u201csetting up an Audio return channel\u201d. Take care and God bless."

                    "Answer": "Depends on how much use you get out of it. The Contrast is better... Base sound doubled and the stand is made of metel unlike the 60 which is plastic and has a metal clasp for cable management, while the 60 has plastic clips. Whites are better on the 60 while blacks are better on the 70, overall 70s picture quality is sharper. If your not looking to upgrade say in the next 4yrs, than 70 is worth it as it'll handle all the new Highend streaming coming to the future. If you upgrade every few yrs than no... 70 is already behind considering there is the QLED90 with 8K video... if you get a great deal, than yes! If you don't watch a lot of movies or streaming than no... 60 is beautiful and so sharp and clear. I got the 60 cause cost was great for the quality and everything will be in 8k soon... so by 2020/21 8k will be more affordable and the 80 and 90 series Samsung will be dropped loke the 60 and 70 through holoday deals."

My nature is to buy better tech, but in this case I finally realized that the difference between my old TV and the Q60 would be so startling that the difference between the Q60 and Q70 would subjectively be minimal.

                    "Answer": "I am not sure what you mean by \"navigate the iPad from the tv/monitor\", but yes you can connect your iPad to it with the correct cables. Depending on the version of iPad you have the type of cable needed might be different, but I believe if you have a newer model of the iPad that you would need a type-C to HDMI cable which would allow you to see what is on your iPad screen on the television screen. If by navigate you mean using the television to control your ipad then that is not possible. Hope this helps"

                    "Answer": "The TV itself does not have internet, but it is internet capable which is what you meant I am sure. As for a browser goes, it does come with a browser installed that is simply called \"Internet\" and I would imagine you could download other browsers as well from the app store. Now to address what David said about Samsung needing to support your Internet Provider. I am positive that is 100% incorrect. The provider would have absolutely nothing to do with the television being able to connect to the internet. As long as you have a modem with a Cat 5 cable to plug into the television or a Wifi enabled router to broadcast a Wifi signal for the television to pick up then you would be able to connect to the internet. The television wouldn't know the difference between Spectrum or At&t or any other provider and if it did it would not matter."

                    "Answer": "Yes it can be mounted on the wall. It has 4 holes with Phillips head screws in them on the back of the TV. This is where you would attach the TV to the mounting system. Most mounting systems are universal these days so I would think almost any of them would work for this TV. Or you could do like my Grandpa did and connect a piece of wire from one screw across to another and hang the TV like you would hang a picture on the wall! LOL and yes he really did this and it actually worked just fine."

I do see that this question was asked in June of 2018 so maybe at that time this particular model was on backorder as this model was actually built in 2018 which would create the delay. Anyone who orders it now should expect it in a few days."

The sleep timer lets you choose from 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes for the TV to shut off. The off timer lets you select a certain time like 10:00 P.M. to turn off the TV and it also allows you to schedule different times for different days of the week."

                    "Answer": "I just searched the app store built into the television and it was not there so I would say no. However you may still be able to do so by using some sort of 3rd party application. For example on the Firesticks you can Jailbreak them allowing you to download any app you want even if it is not in their app store. I am sure there is a way to do something similar on this TV, but as is the case with firestick, doing so will void your warranty."

To answer your question it does have Samsung TV Plus and gives you an additional 120+ channels. With that said I did read somewhere that Samsung TV Plus is only available in some areas.

First is by using a Bluetooth headset and connecting directly to the TV via Bluetooth. Second, you could but a wire that converts the red and white audio cables to a headphone jack port which would allow you to plug in a standard pair of headphones. The third option I could think of is how my father has his set up which is by hooking the television up to a stereo receiver, setting the sounds settings to play through said receiver, and hooking up either wired or wireless headphones to the receiver. I hope this helps!"

When you press the channel button an area on the middle right of the screen pops up with the channel number for the channel you are on as well as the name of what show is on and the name of the channel. Also on the top and bottom of that is the next and previous channel numbers. However I have no idea how good your eyes are or how big your room is, so it's hard to give a definite answer. You could have horrible vision and be in a large room 30 feet from the television or great vision and be sitting 5 feet from it. I will say that I have perfect vision and can see it no problem 15 feet away, and I am confident I would be able to see it well from 30 feet if needed. Anyways I hope this helps answer your question. Also in case you do not already know, this television comes with Samsung TV Plus which gives you an additional 129 channels for free, you just need internet to use it. I think its awesome!"

                    "Question": "Can I connect my dvd and vhs tape players to this?",
                    "Answer": "You can definitely connect them. How you connect them depends on a number of different factors. This television has an hdmi port, coax cable port, and an optical audio port. It does not have the RCA ports (Red, Yellow, and White wires) that I am guessing your VCR uses for sure, and possibly even your DVD player depending on how old it is. With that said most newer televisions will not come with RCA ports because they are such dated technology. However there are still ways to co nect your VCR and DVD player if they are RCA. You will need to buy a female RCA to male HDMI cable converter. This would allow you to plug the RCA cables from you VCR/DVD player into the converter and then the converter into the HDMI port on the back of the TV. However you would not be able to plug them both in at the same time if they both require RCA cables (even if you bought 2 converters) because this television unfortunately only has 1 HDMI port. You could possibly have both connected by plugging one component into the other and then into the TV. Or you could purchase a female RCA to male Coax Cable for one component which would allow you to plug one into the coax cable and then the other into the HDMI port. I know it sounds complicated but its really not that hard. If you have difficulties reach out to any teenager you know and im sure they will be able to help. Besides doing all of that you could also just upgrade your DVD player to blu ray which would use hdmi, but I don't know what you would do about the VCR. I have not used one in over 20 years but I am guessing you must have something on VHS that you like watching. I would suggest having your VHS tapes converted to DVD because its probably not too long before you won't be able to buy a VCR anywhere, if you can still now even. Plus converting them to DVD will ensure they last longer and you can also have the quality enhanced. You can have this done by a professional or you can buy a machine to do it yourself. Anyways i hope all of this helps!"

If your referring to connecting to this television and using it as a wireless monitor, than yes you can do that. Also it does come with an internet browser installed and you can also download other internet browsers from the app store so it can be used to browse the internet like you would do on a computer.

                    "Answer": "You have 2 routes. Either a simple soundbar straight to the tv or hooking speakers into a receiver and running a HDMI cord from the receiver to the TV. Speakers hook into receiver with speaker wire. I have 5.0 surround hooked into a receiver. My receiver is 4k compliant. If it wasn't then the signal gets downgraded. Good quality speakers are great. I'm sure addition more speakers is better but 5 speakers is a huge upgrade from TV speakers. You can add subwoofers and even ceiling speakers. Dolby Atmos is for special setups like ceiling speakers. Otherwise you don't really need the most expensive receiver as long as it can handle the amount of speakers you want and again is 4k compliant."

Samsung is no different, hence 'motion rate 120'. don't be fooled by these manufacturers who thrive on uninformed consumers."

So I purchase the same model through BestBuy as my alternative. Overall it has a very nice picture, good speakers and looks marvelous. I use this TV to watch MLBTV, movies and play all my video games on it. The only feature I don't like is an \"auto-brightness adjust\" that adjusts the screens brightness depending on how bright your room is or how bright other devices nearby might cause it change. That part is annoying and I am sure there is a feature where you can turn it off but at the moment I'm just still enjoying the TV and making the most out of it."

At my house, I have never connected the Q6FN to the internet and consequently never had any issues with it. You can still manually update the TV's firmware via a USB stick, which if you never intend on hooking it up to the internet, would only do if you're trying to resolve a problem (HDMI-CEC, Receiver Issues, Display Issues, etc) or if a new TV feature is released that you absolutely have to have."

For instance, HDR10 supports a maximum picture brightness of 1,000 nits for TVs. Dolby Vision can go much brighter \u2014 up to 10,000 nits. If that sounds like overkill, when it comes to your TV, it is. For the moment, there are no TVs you can buy that are capable of displaying 10,000 nits of brightness or the 68 billion colors that Dolby Vision provides. Even the brightest TVs on the market tend to max out at 2,000 nits of brightness, Dolby Vision is a proprietary, dynamic HDR format developed by Dolby Labs. By adjusting the picture on a scene-by-scene (and even frame-by-frame) basis, it lets you see more detail with better color accuracy."

I often recommend Chief brackets since you can adjust the TV left or right if the studs in your wall don't line up with how you wish to center the TV. You'll want to run HDMI cables for each device you are connecting, and you'll need an electrical outlet behind the TV for power. If you can get a hardwired ethernet connection from the TV to your router I recommend this over using wifi for streaming movies. You'll also want to connect an optical audio cable from the back of the TV to a soundbar or audio system should you choose to add it."

They can be set at nearly 48\u201d apart or they can be placed closer as there are additional inserts for the legs that are set nearly 35\u201d apart. Both work well, I suppose it was made an option because of the TVs size in reference to most entertainment centers. I initially had mine set at the 35\u201d but it didn\u2019t look right because my center is large so I changed them to the 48\u201d. The photos you see in the pics are set at the 48\u201d, just to give you an idea. I hope that helps."

                    "Answer": "I believe the formula is: measure the distance from the TV to the viewing point, in inches. Divide this by three. This is the size TV recommended for this distance. So, 16 feet would give you 64\". Sitting farther away would not get you a better picture. But with the 4K you can sit much closer because of the increase in pixels. My viewing point for my 65 inch is 10 feet and I think it\u2019s great. I might even I sit closer, but I have a coffee table and recliner\u2019s which forced me back to 10 to 12 feet. They say that if you cannot see the individual pixels, you\u2019re OK. But the TV is so darn bright, that sitting up closer would be uncomfortable. And no, I do not have poor vision."

The Samsung upscaler is one of the better ones on the market and the 55, 65, 75, & 82 inch version of this tv (MU8000) all have 120hz panels and potentially the best 2017 non-oled model on the market in terms of low latency at 17to19ms for 4k & upscaled content & 24ms in non-UHD content in game or pc mode (the lower the latency the better for gaming). The 49' panel is only 60hz and I am not sure about the latency, personally I would just go with the 55, 65, 75, or 82 inch if your budget permits.

I never got past the forced sponsor adds and and could not get my satellite to even connect. I bought this tv to get upgraded picture quality but never got it to work well enough to test that feature. All I wanted was a tv with an on/off remote that I could use and watch my programs.

The bezel is silver and very thin on the sides & top & maybe 1/2\" or so on the bottom. On the top and sides there is a small black border inside the silver bezel which is roughly 1/4\" or so, possibly smaller, its very thin. The back is black with a brushed like texture.

                    "Answer": "What I\u2019ve noticed is that streaming services broadcast at different volume levels. Who knows why. I don\u2019t use the TV speakers because I run all my audio through my home entertainment set up and even so volume levels can vary widely between services and even between individual channels when I\u2019m watching live TV on my satellite service. My guess is this is why you\u2019re having to change volume levels repeatedly and that there is nothing wrong with the TV itself."

The external box has 4 hdmi connections, 1 threaded antenna connection, 1 optical audio, and 2 usb ports. I believe all of them except the optical audio are used for \"signal in\" to the tv. I use the optical audio jack to get audio to my stereo so I can use my stereo speakers. I'm not sure, but I don't think you can do what you want unless you have an audio/video stereo receiver.

                    "Answer": "4K Ultra High Definition is definitely a clearer, sharper picture with better color IF you take the time to set it up the way you like. Keep in mind though, there aren't a whole lot of 4K UHD tv shows or movies available yet. If you have Netflix they offer a selection of maybe 100 movies/tv shows that are in 4K but they cost $3 (maybe it's $4) a month more. 4K blu rays are also about 25% more expensive, like $25 compared to $20 for regular blu ray.. I like it and think it's worth it, you may not."

I tried that but then I had to use three different remotes to operate my TV, STB and surround sound amplifier. Fortunately, mine just turns itself ON Not OFF. I think Samsung needs to address this issue since what I've read this has been happening to certain of their TV's since 2012. Good Luck!"

                    "Answer": "I think your question was misunderstood. Let me attempt to clarify the question. He wants to know if the picture quality of regular 1080i high definition will look better/upscale higher on the 8k version of this set than on the 4k version. While I believe this was his question, I cannot give a definitive firsthand answer as I don't own either set. (Saving up now) However, I assume the 8k set will make it's best effort to upscale 1080 to 8k and the 4k set will make its best effort to upscale 1080 to 4k. I don't know if in the end there would be an appreciable difference in the resulting picture quality, although it should. If anyone with firsthand experience could comment on this, it would be greatly appreciated as I have the same question."

                    "Question": "How many hdmi 2.1 cables do I need?",
                    "Answer": "For connecting from your receiver to the television, the answer is one. The One Connect box has 4 HDMI inputs if you're connecting individual components. However, the easiest way is to connect all of your components to your receiver and then send the one HDMI cable to your television. By doing this, you get better sound especially if your sound system has a subwoofer attached. This television uses High Definition Copy Protection (HDCP) so you need to make sure all your components and cables are HDCP compliant. For example, I use Tivo which has streaming capability. However, the Tivo is not HDCP compliant. I had to buy a Roku box for my streaming. HDCP primarily applies to movies including Blu-Ray not television shows. You will get the best results with a 4K Blu-Ray player and 4K movies. Again, makes sure all components from which you watch movies are HDCP compliant (Blu-Ray player, movie streamer, & receiver)."

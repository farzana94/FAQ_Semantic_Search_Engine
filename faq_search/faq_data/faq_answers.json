This television has an hdmi port, coax cable port, and an optical audio port. It does not have the RCA ports (Red, Yellow, and White wires) that I am guessing your VCR uses for sure, and possibly even your DVD player depending on how old it is. With that said most newer televisions will not come with RCA ports because they are such dated technology. However there are still ways to co nect your VCR and DVD player if they are RCA. You will need to buy a female RCA to male HDMI cable converter. This would allow you to plug the RCA cables from you VCR/DVD player into the converter and then the converter into the HDMI port on the back of the TV. However you would not be able to plug them both in at the same time if they both require RCA cables (even if you bought 2 converters) because this television unfortunately only has 1 HDMI port. You could possibly have both connected by plugging one component into the other and then into the TV. Or you could purchase a female RCA to male Coax Cable for one component which would allow you to plug one into the coax cable and then the other into the HDMI port. I know it sounds complicated but its really not that hard. If you have difficulties reach out to any teenager you know and im sure they will be able to help. Besides doing all of that you could also just upgrade your DVD player to blu ray which would use hdmi, but I don't know what you would do about the VCR. I have not used one in over 20 years but I am guessing you must have something on VHS that you like watching. I would suggest having your VHS tapes converted to DVD because its probably not too long before you won't be able to buy a VCR anywhere, if you can still now even. Plus converting them to DVD will ensure they last longer and you can also have the quality enhanced. You can have this done by a professional or you can buy a machine to do it yourself.
